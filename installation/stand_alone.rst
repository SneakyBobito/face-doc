Standalone installation
========

This section explains how to install Face in a new project.

If can also start a project with a framework from one of our skeleton project : check the framework integration page.



Requirements
--------------

* **PHP 5.4** or later
* A **mysql** database. For the moment only MySQL is supported. Because we are fan of open sources project, we recommand you to use `MariaDB`_ . PostgreSQL and SQLite will be supported in next versions.
* The **peek** library that will be downloaded automatically with composer
* **PDO** that is natively available in standard PHP 5.4 or later



Installation
--------------

Face uses `composer`_.

To use composer start by creating a file named `composer.json` at the root of your project.
Fill it with the following content :

.. code-block:: json

    {
        "require": {
            "face/face": "0.1.1-BETA1"
        }
    }

Then from your terminal cd to the root of your directory and install the dependancies :

.. code-block:: shell

    cd path/to/project/root/
    curl -sS https://getcomposer.org/installer | php
    php composer.phar install


This will download face into your project. It will also download the Peek library. Peek is just a collection of useful functions not present within php.


Finally include the autoloader generated by composer into you project. All your scripts have to include the following :

.. code-block:: php

    require_once 'vendor/autoload.php';


Starting your project
--------------

Now you have to generate your models for the project. Jump to the  :doc:`models generations <generation>` section.
