Generation
========


The hardest work when you use an orm is to prepare your models that you already have prepared in your database.

Obviously Face is not an exception, you will have to map your model classes with your database.
But we are aware that it is a repetitive work and we try to place a constant effort to avoid this work.

That's why Face offers a tool that will generate your models for you : `Face-Embryo`_.

We really encourage you to use it. It will help to start your projects faster.

Note that for the moment Embryo only works with mysql.



Install Embryo
-----------

Embryo is a tool that will generate  some .php files for you. Face will use these php files.
In this way you can start a project even with a weak knowledge of Face. You just will have to write your queries

Embryo installation was tested under Debian. You will maybe have to adapt the following to your distro/OS.


Firstly download or clone the sources from github : https://github.com/laemons/face-embryo

Place it anywhere you want on your computer
