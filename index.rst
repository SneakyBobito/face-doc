Welcome to Face's documentation!
================================

Face is an ORM built under php5.4. It is aimed to be flexible and 
to provide powerful features to abstract and normalize database interactions.

In the latest weeks face has known a lot of refactoring and a lot are on the way.

The doc was not relevant anymore and has been temporally closed until the new doc is written.

We plan the first stable release of face for end of 2015. Stay tuned !
