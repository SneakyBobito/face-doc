   You can adapt this file completely to your liking, but it should at least
   contain the root `toctree` directive.

Welcome to Face's documentation!
================================

Face is an ORM built under php5.4.

It is neither a micro ORM, nor a full featured ORM, we would place it in the middle.
That's why we recommand you to use it for little or medium sized projetcs.

Most of all, Face is the first ORM that use php5.4's trait instead of extending your classes !
You are free to use inheritance as you want while your `faces` remain like your database schemas.

.. note::

    Be aware that face is still in early **beta testing**. Some component are still not ready and some functionalities may drasticaly change on the master branche.

    Face is **not** ready for production purpose.
