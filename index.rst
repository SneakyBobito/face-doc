Welcome to Face's documentation!
================================

Face is an ORM built under php5.4. It is aimed to be flexible and to provide powerful features to abstract and normalize database interactions.

In the latest weeks face has known a lot of refactoring. The doc was not anymore relevant and has been temporally closed until the new doc is written.

We plan the first stable release of face for April 2015. Stay tuned !
