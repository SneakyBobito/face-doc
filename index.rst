   You can adapt this file completely to your liking, but it should at least
   contain the root `toctree` directive.

Welcome to Face's documentation!
================================

Face is an ORM built under php5.4.

It is neither a micro ORM, nor a full featured ORM, we may place it in the middle.

Most of all, Face is the first ORM that use php5.4's trait instead of extending your classes !
